### Markdown
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a language used on GitHub mainly to write README.md files. A file written in markdown on GitHub is indicated by .md. The formatting of Markdown is as follows:
* _Italic_ words are surrounded by underscores `_italic_`
* **Bold** words are surrounded by two asterisks on either side `**bold**`
* Headers come in six sizes and begin with a hashtag #, one hashtag makes the largest size and six hashtags make the smallest size `# Title1`
* Each item in an unordered list begins with an asterisk, and each item in an ordered list begins with a number and a period 
  * Indented items in a list have two spaces before the asterisk
* Paragraphs need two spaces afterwards for a soft break or a return afterwards for a hard break
* Links are made of two parts, a description written in [] and the link contained in () [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* Images are formatted the same as links with a ! in front of the first brackets 
* The tick above the tab key `creates a monospace`
