## Continuous Integration
Continuous integration is the frequent compilation of all separate copies of a project to the main branch of a repository. Integration of a copy into the mainline can fail without continuous integration because changes can be made to the main branch after the copy is made that the copy would then not reflect. The user would then have to revise his or her code to update changes, which is referred to as "integration hell" because it can take a long time. Continuous integration requires frequent merging of copies with the main branch and tests for every commit so that errors can be identified and corrected immediately.

## Travis CI
[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) can run on GitHub â€” log in to Travis CI through your GitHub account and enable Travis CI builds. Each addition to code is tested by Travis CI and either passes or fails as indicated on the build status page. To run Travis CI on a GitHub repository, add a .travis.yml file to the repository. This file details the language of the project, what dependencies to install, what to use to do a build, and what to test against. The .travis.yml file is written in YAML format. Once the .travis.yml file is configured correctly on GitHub and the tab for the repo is switched to on in Travis settings, Travis will run builds after every commit to the GitHub repo. In the .travis.yml file, the script block are the main commands that are executed.

### How to Display Build Passing Badge on GitHub
A badge ([![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laurelmcintyre/c-makefile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/laurelmcintyre/c-makefile)) displays the status of your build from Travis CI onto your GitHub page. To display the badge on a README page, go to Travis. By the account name should be the build passing badge. Click on it and a window will pop up. Change the setting to Markdown and copy and paste the link it generates into the README page.
